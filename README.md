# Issues for NationStates

This repository contains the source for Issues for NationStates, an upcoming iOS app to keep track of ones NationStates issues on the go.

# ✨ Features 
- 📰 Get an overview of your pending issues
- 🕰 Know when the next issue arrives
- 📖 Read up on issues
- 📝 Respond appropriately by passing legislations 
- 📈 Keep track of your nation and its characteristics 
- 📦 Comes with a widget that displays issues on the home screen 

# ⏰ Future releases
The initial release will only be focused on answering your nation's issues. NationStates has a lot more game mechanics than that, this project will keep adding features. The idea is to iterate quickly and utilize user feedback, either from within the application or from the NationStates forums.
